					<h4><span>Talk:</span> Reusable Code, for good or for awesome!</h4>
					<p>What sets reusable code apart from other code? How can we make our code developer-friendly, fast, robust &amp; compatible?</p>
<p>In this talk we'll cover testing, working with compressors, measuring performance, but concentrating on API design.</p>
<p>We'll analyse existing APIs, looking at what makes them good, or in some cases wonder what their creator may have been smoking at the time.</p>
<p>By looking at the wins and fails in the real world, we can discover what makes code a pleasure to use and reuse.</p>				</div>

					<h3>Zbigniew Braniecki</h3>
					<p>Zbigniew Braniecki is a social activist, software engineer and sociologist who works on the intersection between code and people. He started early as a webdev, got into web tools in the year 2000 as a co-author of a famous Polish Alladyn JS library, and after working on backends and frontends of all kinds he took the leap into shaping up the web browser space founding <a href="http://aviary.pl">Aviary.pl</a> team, joining Mozilla Europe and the Flock project where he spent a few years building a new open source social-oriented web browser. Finally, he decided to get closer to his project of choice, and accepted a position at Mozilla where he holds a &quot;Community Ninja&quot; title these days.</p>					<h4><span>Talk:</span> Harvesting opinions - Firefox 4 beta</h4>
					<p>Mozilla has always aimed to innovate and improve ways that empower its global community to work together in harmony and produce world class products. It's what we call "a hybrid approach", where staff and volunteers work side by side.</p>
<p>As we prepare to release Firefox 4, the most important revision of Firefox since its 1.0 release, we are doing something no one has ever succeeded in doing before - collaborate with an army of 2 million beta testers and help them share their opinions on Firefox 4 UI/UX and influence decision-making in deep, meaningful way, blending it seamlessly into the world of our small UX task force team.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we had to develop collaborative processes and tools, and go that extra mile to be as open and inclusive as possible. This is the Mozilla way of working, and we are happy we got the results we wanted while staying true to our values. In my presentation I'll show you how we did this.</p>				</div>

					<p>HTML5 is the first major revision to the web's lingua franca in over
10 years and disrupting web development as we know it.</p>
<p>In this presentation Tantek illuminates what makes HTML5 both easier
and more powerful, which HTML5 features are ready now, roughly usable,
unfortunately ugly, or worthy of web application experiments. HTML5 is
also a work in progress - learn how by using it and providing
feedback, anyone can help shape this important update to the
foundation of the web.</p>
<p>Finally, Tantek will touch on a little bit of CSS3, microformats, and
Javascript that every professional web design or developer speaker
should be using.</p>				</div>

					<p>Mobile devices and netbooks are suffering, even if already capable of showing different parts of HTML5.</p>

<p>There are many developers and books out there that are rarely considering optimizations able to make the difference, when performances are essentials.</p>

<p>Let's discover together, through benchmarks and examples, how faster we could be, and how "the real less" can do more!</p>				</div>

					<h4><span>Talk:</span> Using data of the web and offering your own services with JavaScript and HTML5</h4>
					<p>In this session Christian Heilmann will show you how easy it is nowadays to use the power of web services in JavaScript. Using YQL, you can turn any data on the web into a JSON object to use in your scripts and you can even move your JavaScript solutions server-side on a hosted platform to offer them as services to the world. The web is a big sweet-shop of data and with a system like YQL, a dash of JavaScript and using some of the new HTML5 APIs you can create impressive apps in a matter of minutes.</p>				</div>

					<h3>Christian Johansen</h3>
					<p>Originally a student in informatics, mathematics, and digital signal processing, Christian has spent his professional career specializing in web and front-end development with technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML using agile practices.</p>

<p>After working on several projects with less than trivial amounts of JavaScript, Christian has felt the pain of developing ``the cowboy style''.  In an attempt at improving code quality, confidence and the ability to modify and maintain code with greater ease he has spent a great deal of his time both at work and in his spare time over the last few years investigating unit testing and test driven development in JavaScript. Being a sworn TDD-er while developing in traditional server-side languages, the cowboy style JavaScript approach wasn't cutting it anymore. The culmination of this passion is the book "Test-Driven JavaScript Development", out on Addison-Wesley September 2010.</p>					<h4><span>Talk:</span> Test-first JavaScript</h4>
					<p>Why - and how - will Test-Driven Development (TDD) help you become a more productive programmer while at the same time improve code quality? That's what we'll figure out in this session. Christian will guide you through developing a small widget guided by tests, highlighting good and bad unit testing practices as he goes. Along the way, Christian will also show you when and how to use stubs (and mocks). Topping it all off he'll use state-of-the art tools for JavaScript unit testing and continuous integration.</p>				</div>

					<p>Web technologies are conquering the mobile space and will eventually be more important than the various native platforms. However, mobile is different from desktop, and web technologies will be used differently. In this future-oriented session we'll discuss one use of JavaScript that just doesn't apply to the desktop world: sending JSON data over SMS. This session will be conceptual, and not too technical.</p>				</div>

					<h3>Markus Leutwyler</h3>
					<p>Markus Leutwyler is a web- and mobile developer living in Switzerland. When not working on enterprise web applications, he likes to bring webOS applications from concept to app catalog. He&apos;s an active member of the webOS development community.</p>					<h4><span>Talk:</span> You know webOS</h4>
					<p>We've seen the rise of web apps, written in HTML/CSS/Javascript, running on top of WebKit. Palm's webOS treats web apps as first citizens, even the built-in apps are built that way. We'll take a closer look at what webOS is and how to develop web apps for it. If you are a web developer, you'll feel right at home with webOS.</p>				</div>

					<h3>Kyle Simpson</h3>
					<p>Kyle Simpson is a UI architect from Austin, TX. He is passionate about user experience, specifically optimizing the UI to be as responsive, efficient, secure, and scalable as possible. He considers JavaScript the ultimate language and is constantly tinkering with how to push it further. If something can't be done in JavaScript or web technology, he's bored by it. He has a number of open-source projects, including <a href="http://labjs.com/">LABjs</a>, HandlebarJS/BikechainJS, and <a href="http://flxhr.flensed.com/">flXHR</a>, and he also is a core contributor to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject">SWFObject.</a></p>					<h4><span>Talk:</span> JavaScript: The Rise of the Middle-End</h4>
					<p>We all know that web performance optimization is becoming critical to  the success of web sites and applications. The problem is, we often don’t have the control over the UI Architecture (“middle-end”) that we need to really make things better.</p>

<p>We’ll talk about how to use JavaScript (client- and server-side) to  revamp the middle-end so we can throttle web performance (and code  maintainability) to the next level.</p>				</div>

					<h3>Kamil Trebunia</h3>
					<p>Kamil is a software developer with 7 years of experience in the field, and has been fascinated with front-end, open standards and JavaScript engineering. He is currently a software developer consultant working for Nokia using open web technologies on top of Webkit-based platform. Recently, his fascination shifted to everything mobile: performance, good practices and standards-compatible ways to develop code once and run on multiple platforms.</p>

<p>His previous experience includes some heavy JavaScript programming (<a href="https://www.sencha.com/blog/2009/05/27/implementation-spotlight-zipwhip-and-ext-js/">featured and acclaimed on Sencha Ext JS blog</a>) for web, desktop, Facebook and iGoogle platforms at Zipwhip (Seattle-based startup producing software for US telecom carriers), crafting a hi-quality markup and stylesheets at XHTMLized and a lead JS developer position at Grono.net (the biggest Polish social network during his employment).</p> 
					<h4><span>Talk:</span> Cross-device applications development</h4>
					<p>Kamil will talk about the development of mobile applications with technologies that let you write code once and run it on several mobile phones platforms (and beyond that), all that using your favorite JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</p>
<p>He will talk about different toolkits that enable cross-platform applications development with the focus on his framework of choice - PhoneGap. You will learn how to build your first application and about the tools and JavaScript frameworks you can use. Combining experience from his current project at Nokia and his own personal research he will discuss best practices, platforms performance and challenges that you will inevitably have to deal with when developing for mobiles.</p>
<p>On top of that we will see who else is using PhoneGap and learn when it is the right approach and when it would be better to stick to multiple dedicated applications.</p>				</div>

<p>In this 2-hour practical session, full of real world use cases, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything you ever wanted to know about CSS3 selectors</li>
<li>Transparency and new color formats, including RGBA</li>
<li>New ways to work with backgrounds, including CSS gradients, multiple background images and natively supported CSS sprites</li>
<li>Rounded corners and border images</li>
<li>Box and text shadows</li>
<li>Transforms, transitions and their potential downsides</li>
<li>New values, including calc(), attr() and new units</li>
<li>Browser support information and techniques to take advantage of the exciting new stuff with respect to browsers of the past, to create experiences that are enjoyable for everyone</li>
